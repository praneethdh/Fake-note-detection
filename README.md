# 💵 Currency Note Authentication using OpenCV

This project is a **computer vision–based currency note authentication system** built using **Python and OpenCV**.  
It verifies whether a currency note image is **Real or Fake** by comparing it with reference images using **ORB feature matching**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Uses image feature matching to verify currency notes
- Compares test note images against real reference notes
- Detects authenticity based on match percentage
- Displays side-by-side visual comparison
- Designed for learning image processing and feature detection concepts

---

## ✨ Features

- ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detection
- Brute-Force descriptor matching
- Automatic denomination extraction from filename
- Real vs Fake classification based on match threshold
- Visual comparison using OpenCV windows
- Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` formats

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- ORB Feature Detection
- Brute-Force Matcher
- Regular Expressions (regex)
